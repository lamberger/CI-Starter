CI-Starter

This is how I start some of my CI projects. Includes Codeigniter v2.1.0, a CSS folder with a style.css, a js folder with a scripts.js, img folder and a htaccess file with some code to get rid of index.php. Rename download folder to CI-Start and you should be good to go. You can name the project to what ever you like, just remember to change the name in htaccess as well. I load content through a template. A technique I learned from Jeffrey Way at Nettuts.
